#### My Research Interests  
Since the beginning of my research career at [Bangladesh Agricultural University](https://www.bau.edu.bd/), I had been involved in several ad-hoc research. However, currently I have narrowed down the scope of my research area and focusing heavily on the following themes:
-  Aquatic ecology  
-  Riparian ecosystems  
-  Ecology of invasive plants  
-  Phytoremediation of metals from soil and water

#### Past Research Projects  

----   

**1. Ecology of invasion and competition of *Pueraria lobata* and *Sicyos angulatus* on Japanese riparian area.**

*Pueraria lobata* and *Sicyos angulatus* are invasive plants in Japan. Though *P. lobata* has naturalized in Japan, it is thought to be of China origin. It usually inhabits fallow lands. *S. angulatus*, on the other hand, is a weed in arable land associated with corn, wheat or other crops in western countries.  It was introduced in Japan few decades ago with crop seeds. However, recently both species have invaded the riparian landscape of the country and they caused decline of native riparian species, for example *Miscanthus sacchariflorus* They have notorious growth rates and given favorable conditions, they can quickly cover a wide area within very short time.  Though both *Pueraria lobata* and *Sicyos angulatus* are vine, they have different succession pattern and growth strategy. Sometimes they compete with each other for the space.

In this study we investigated their succession pattern in riparian landscape and the hydrological and edaphic factors that govern their competitive and succession abilities.

**2. Phytoremediation of (metal) contaminated waters by using Charophytes.**

Charophytes is a group of macrophytes which is ubiquities in freshwater ecosystems. Due to the alternative acid and alkaline bands along the internodes, it precipitate calcite on its stem. During this process, it also entrap other metals inside the calcite. This calcite are relatively stable and after the death of the plant, the tissue resist decomposition for a considerable period of time. For this properties of Charophytes, we have investigated its ability to remediate toxic metals from water.
