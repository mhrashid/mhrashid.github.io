#### My Biography in a Nutshell   
I graduated from Bangladesh Agricultural University, and I started my teaching and research career in Agronomy (crop production) in the same institution.  Then I moved to Saitama University  for Ph.D. After finishing doctoral study, I kept my attachment with Saitama University as JSPS postdoctoral fellow and then as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Environmental Science.

In the course of my doctoral and postdoctoral research and at present, I have been studying various aspects of environmental issues, and terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.  More specifically, this has involved the study of riparian areas, and lake and wetland environments where my team conducted  field works throughout Japan.

I am also studying the mechanical stresses of submerged plants, the calcification of charopytes those qualify for phytoremediation. Besides this limnological research, I have been working on river channel forestation and the development of a dynamic vegetative prediction tool. My current project aims to develop a vegetation models with special emphasis on mycorrhizal symbiosis with riparian plants.  I have gathered my experience from a wide range of fields and intend to apply those experiences in the real world.
