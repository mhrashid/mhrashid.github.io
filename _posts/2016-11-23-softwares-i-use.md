For my daily activities, I need to use many softwares. Some of them need user license while others are free of cost. Though I am a casual user of Windows PC, I often use Linux (Ubuntu), and occasionally MAC OS. I use these operating systems in coordination because each has some functionality that serves me better. Whenever I need to start using a software, I first check for a free version.

Be aware of 'freewares', 'free softwares', 'opensource softwares', 'sharewares', etc. In case of softwares, the term 'free' can be used differently. Please refer to [this post](http://www.thewindowsclub.com/difference-freeware-free-software-open-source) for detailed meaning.
